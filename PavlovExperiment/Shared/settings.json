A purpose of this experiment is to see how well people can detect when things \"go-together\". The experiment has several stages. The first stage is to help familiarize you with the procedure. In this first stage you will be presented with common words. It will be important to watch the screen closely during this first stage. At some points during this stage you will be asked if the two most recent words go together. To indicate if two words go together you will use the computers mouse to click the \"YES\" button – if the previous two words do not go together then click the \"NO\" button.\n\nClick the \"START\" button to begin.","ptInstructionEvalText":"Now it is time to see how well you remember the stimuli that go together. In this next stage of the experiment you will see pairs of words followed by a chance to indicate whether or not those two words \"go-together\".
